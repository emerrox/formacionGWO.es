// This file is now mostly empty as form submission is handled client-side
// for static export. Server actions are not compatible with output: 'export'.

// If you had other server actions, they would remain here.
// The Nodemailer related functions (sendMail, createHtmlEmailBody, createPlainTextEmailBody)
// are in src/lib/nodemailer.ts and are no longer directly used by the contact form
// in this static export setup.
